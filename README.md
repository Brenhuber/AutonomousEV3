# AutonomousEV3
This project is from my introductory engineering class in the first semester of university (Fall 2023). I designed and built a Lego EV3 vehicle capable of performing various tasks, including color sensing, distance recognition, and corrections. Using MATLAB, I programmed the vehicle to operate autonomously.

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and plan to delve deeper into robotics in the future.
