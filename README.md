# AutonomousRC
This is a project from my introduction engineering class that took place my first semeter of university (fall 2023). I designed and built a Lego EV3 vehicle to carry out various actions such as: color sensing, distance recognition, and corrections. Using MATLAB programming, I was able to code the functionality of the vehicle making it automnomous. 

I enjoyed working on this and plan on diving further into robotics in the future.
