### üöÄ Overview

**AutonomousEV3** is a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 project developed during my first semester of university (Fall 2023). The challenge was to program a vehicle capable of navigating a maze and performing mission-critical tasks entirely autonomously using **MATLAB**.

### ‚ú® Objectives & Features
- Design and build a **Lego EV3 robot** with:
  - **Color sensing**
  - **Distance detection**
  - **Navigation correction mechanisms**
- Use **MATLAB** to code the robot's logic and task execution  
- Complete the mission by:
  - **Traversing a maze**
  - **Locating and picking up a wheelchair**
  - **Delivering it safely** to a designated drop-off
- **Follow traffic laws** (e.g., stop at red signs)
- Dynamically target three **color-coded checkpoints**: yellow ‚Üí blue ‚Üí green  
- Prioritize destinations based on **hierarchical logic**
- Maintain awareness of current path and actions taken
