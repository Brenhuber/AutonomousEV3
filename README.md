# AutonomousEV3
This project is from my introductory engineering class in the first semester of university (Fall 2023). I designed and built a Lego EV3 vehicle capable of performing various tasks, including color sensing, distance recognition, and corrections. Using MATLAB, I programmed the vehicle to operate autonomously.

The goal was to traverse a maze, locate and pick up a wheelchair with the vehicle, and deliver it to the specified destination by targeting three checkpoints: yellow, blue, and green. The vehicle had to follow traffic laws (e.g., stopping at a red stop sign) and perform these tasks safely without damaging the wheelchair and its contents. The checkpoints were prioritized, and the vehicle had to navigate to them based on their 
order hierarchy and further information while keeping track of its path and when to retrieve the wheelchair.

I'm proud to say I placed first in my class. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and plan to delve deeper into robotics in the future.
